# Pac-Man Game

### Introduction
Our project aims to develop an improved version of the Pac-Man game using C programming. We plan to enhance the existing game to provide a more captivating gaming experience.

### Existing System
Pac-Man is a maze-based game where players score points by collecting dots while dodging ghosts to clear levels. The player has a limited number of lives to complete each level; failure to do so results in a game over.

### Problem Statement
The current version of Pac-Man is not challenging enough to maintain players' excitement. It lacks a boss fight that could enhance player interest, and the attacking style of all ghosts is the same. Additionally, there are no diverse power-ups in the existing game.

### Proposed Solution
We propose to add diverse features to each ghost (differentiating their attacking styles) and to Pac-Man, making the game more enjoyable. We will introduce a boss battle that will be challenging to defeat.

### Salient Features
1. Different types of ghosts with unique speeds and attack methods.
2. Introduction of a boss level.
3. Addition of guns in the boss level for both the boss and Pac-Man.
4. Power-ups for Pac-Man after certain points (e.g., shield, invisibility, freeze).
5. Bullet reloading timing mechanism ensuring bullets can be fired only after a 3-second cooldown.
6. Boss fight initiation upon reaching a specific score threshold.
